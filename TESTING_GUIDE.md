## Automated Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
./agent/bin/python test_all_features.py
```

### Run Core Logic Test

```bash
./agent/bin/python test_app_logic.py
```

### Run Minimal Streamlit Test

```bash
./agent/bin/streamlit run test_streamlit_minimal.py --server.port 8502
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'session_state'"
**Solution**: Update Streamlit
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit
```

### Issue: "No module named 'feedparser'"
**Solution**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Architecture mismatch" on Mac M1/M2
**Solution**: Use ARM-compatible Python
```bash
arch -arm64 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Data not appearing
**Solution**: 
1. Check internet connection
2. Try different subreddit
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Clear Streamlit cache: Delete `.streamlit/` folder

### Issue: "TypeError: 'method' object is not iterable"
**Solution**: This has been fixed! Use `content_items` instead of `items` in session state.
